PersonaGoal is a project which seeks to improve upon the typical task system at organizations by providing feedback to every task (if possible) and incentives (when possible). This system of feedback and incentives seeks to inspire workers on a daily basis which will increase work performance.

This was a project ported from PHP as a fun node programming exercise. It is not finished and will not be, but it remains
as a great reminder of my fun Node.js exploits.
