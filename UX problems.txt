UX problems that need to be solved:

How will users register
How will users login?
	(Steve)I'm thinking that everyauth should be used alongside google email login. openid via everyauth is 
	also viable. This would lead to a user not needing to register, but do everything by allowing a login.

How should task lists be presented?
	Should there be a sticky left bar for instance, or maybe a popout leftbar which contains a list of all of 
	the users lists

How should the users information be presented?
	Picture, name, etc
	Should this just not be there, should it be in the sticky bar or popout?
