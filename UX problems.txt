UX problems that need to be solved:

How will users regiser
How will users login?

How should task lists be presented?
	Should there be a sticky left bar for instance, or maybe a popout leftbar which contains a list of all of the users lists

How should the users information be presented?
	Picture, name, etc
	Should this just not be there, should it be in the sticky bar or popout?
