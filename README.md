PersonaGoal is a project which seeks to improve upon the typical task system at organizations by providing feedback to every task (if possible) and incentives (when possible). This system of feedback and incentives seeks to inspire workers on a daily basis which will increase work performance.

Node.js will be the programming language, with an SQL backend because of the number of complicated JOINs which will need to be performed.

This project is maintained by Stephen Bussey.
